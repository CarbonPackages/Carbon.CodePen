## FAQ

_What is the use of Tailwind in this editor? How can I save my generated styles?_

> You can't use it unless you use NodeJS on the server and want to create a pipeline there.
> It is certainly possible to generate styles on the client, as shown in the live preview, but we don't know yet how we can wrap this into a nice API. If you want to help and have ideas about that, feel free to get in touch!
